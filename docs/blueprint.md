- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F4F8), provides a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Light Green (#A5D6A7) for positive actions like deposit, creating a sense of growth.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text, due to its modern, neutral appearance and good legibility.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent transactions, account functions, and investment options.
- Clean, card-based layout for each transaction and investment plan. Ensure that balances, options, and confirmations are clearly visible.
- Subtle transitions and animations to acknowledge user actions like depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds. Ensure it doesn't distract the user from the core information.
